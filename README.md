# Milestone üöß

1. Concept Development: The initial idea for the project is developed and refined. This includes defining the problem the project aims to solve, identifying the target users, and outlining the project's goals and objectives.
2. Smart Contract Development: The smart contracts that will govern the Waste2Earn platform are developed. These smart contracts will handle the logic for collecting waste, recycling, and earning tokens.
3. Frontend Development: The user interface for the Waste2Earn platform is developed. This includes designing and implementing the user interface for the platform, which users will interact with to collect waste, recycle, and earn tokens.
4. Testing: The Waste2Earn platform is tested to ensure it works as expected. This includes testing the smart contracts, the user interface, and the overall functionality of the platform.
5. Deployment: The Waste2Earn platform is deployed to the mainnet. This includes deploying the smart contracts to the mainnet and launching the platform for users to start using.
6. Maintenance and Updates: The Waste2Earn platform is maintained and updated as necessary. This includes fixing any bugs or issues that arise, and updating the platform to add new features or improvements.

üí° As of the moment, we are still under construction and improvement

# How to Run to your localhost:

//Make sure you have installed Node and dfx

```
git clone git@github.com:edmhok/w2etoken.git
cd w2etoken/waste2earn
npm install
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
npm run dev
```

# Check your Balance

1. Find out your principal id:

```
dfx identity get-principal
```

2. Save it somewhere.
   e.g. My principal id is: blah-blah-blah

3. Format and store it in a command line variable:

```
OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx identity get-principal )\""
```

4. Check that step 3 worked by printing it out:

```
echo $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

5. Check the owner's balance:

```
dfx canister call token balanceOf "( $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY )"
```

# Charge the Canister

1. Check canister ID:

```
dfx canister id token
```

2. Save canister ID into a command line variable:

```
CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister id token )\""
```

3. Check canister ID has been successfully saved:

```
echo $CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

4. Transfer half a billion tokens to the canister Principal ID:

```
dfx canister call token transfer "($CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY, 500_000_000)"
```

# Deploy the Project to the Live IC Network

1. Create and deploy canisters:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

2. Check the live canister ID:

```
dfx canister --network ic id token
```

3. Save the live canister ID to a command line variable:

```
LIVE_CANISTER_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister --network ic id token )\""
```

4. Check that it worked:

```
echo $LIVE_CANISTER_KEY
```

5. Transfer some tokens to the live canister:

```
dfx canister --network ic call token transfer "($LIVE_CANISTER_KEY, 50_000_000)"
```

6. Get live canister front-end id:

```
dfx canister --network ic id token_assets
```

7. Copy the id from step 6 and add .raw.ic0.app to the end to form a URL.
   e.g. blah-blah-blah.raw.ic0.app
